GameCubeMaze Objectives:

Primary:
1. Needs to be able to generate a 3d maze where every point is reachable from 
every other point. 

2. Requires two fixed locations: Pacman start and Ghost prison. These may in 
the future be dynamically placed but for now will be static until such a time
as we are confident that game viability is established.

3. The cube will be generated in the server and established in the FieldData.
This field data will be sent to the clients which will use the "wall" class
to build the cube for each player.
